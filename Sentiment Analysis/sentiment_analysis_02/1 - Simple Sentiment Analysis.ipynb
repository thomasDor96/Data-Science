    "\n",
    "We'll be using a **recurrent neural network** (RNN) which reads a sequence of words, and for each word (sometimes called a _step_) will output a _hidden state_. We then use the hidden state for subsequent word in the sentence, until the final word has been fed into the RNN. This final hidden state will then be used to predict the sentiment of the sentence.\n",

If no `tokenize` argument is passed, the default is simply splitting the string on spaces.\n",
