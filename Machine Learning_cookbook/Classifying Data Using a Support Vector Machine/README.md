# Classifying_Data_Using_a_Support_Vector_Machine
This is the code for the "Classifying Data using a Support Vector Machine" by Siraj Raval on Youtube

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/zS1nMu-TOLk) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval on how to use a Support Vector Machine to classify some data. Basically, we create an n-1 dimensional hyperplane that linearly seperates a set of classes in n-dimensional space. Awesome AF. This model is able to tell what category something is of, be that text or numbers or videos or images. 

## Dependencies

* numpy
* matplotlib

## Usage

Just run `jupyter notebook` in terminal and it will run in your browser.

Install Jupyter [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) i've you haven't.
