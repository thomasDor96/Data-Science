    "1. A set of **weights** $w_i$ corresponding to synapses (inputs)\n",
    "2. An **adder** for summing input signals; analogous to cell membrane that collects charge\n",
    "3. An **activation function** for determining when the neuron fires, based on accumulated input\n",
    "\n",
    "The neuron model is shown schematically below. On the left are input nodes $\\{x_i\\}$, usually expressed as a vector. The strength with which the inputs are able to deliver the signal along the synapse is determined by their corresponding weights $\\{w_i\\}$. The adder then sums the inputs from all the synapses:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h = \\sum_i w_i x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\theta$ determines whether or not the neuron fires given a weighted input of $h$. If it fires, it returns a value $y=1$, otherwise $y=0$. For example, a simple **activation function** is using $\\theta$ as a simple fixed threshold:\n",

The take-home message from the perceptron is that all of the learning happens by adapting the synapse weights until prediction is satisfactory. Hence, a reasonable guess at how to make a perceptron more complex is to simply **add more weights**.\n",

    "1. Add backward connections, so that output neurons feed back to input nodes, resulting in a **recurrent network**\n",

Propagating the inputs forward over two layers is straightforward, since the outputs from the hidden layer can be used as inputs for the output layer.

    "We update the weights in a MLP using **back-propagation** of the prediction errors, which is essentially a form of gradient descent, as we have used previously for optimization.\n",

    "First, for the multi-layer perceptron we need to modify the error function, which in the single-layer case was a simple difference between the predicted and observed outputs. Because we will be summing errors, we have to avoid having errors in different directions cancelling each other out, so a sum of squares error is more appropriate:\n",

    "$$E(t,y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i (t_i - y_i)^2$$\n",

    "Its important to be aware that because gradient descent is a hill-climbing (or descending) algorithm, it is liable to be caught in local minima with respect to starting values. Therefore, it is worthwhile training several networks using a range of starting values for the weights, so that you have a better chance of discovering a globally-competitive solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful performance enhancement for the MLP learning algorithm is the addition of **momentum** to the weight updates. This is just a coefficient on the previous weight update that increases the correlation between the current weight and the weight after the next update. This is particularly useful for complex models, where falling into local mimima is an issue; adding momentum will give some weight to the previous direction, making the resulting weights essentially a weighted average of the two directions. Adding momentum, along with a smaller learning rate, usually results in a more stable algorithm with quicker convergence. When we use momentum, we lose this guarantee, but this is generally seen as a small price to pay for the improvement momentum usually gives.\n",

    "A weight update with momentum looks like this:\n",

    "$$w_{jk} \\leftarrow w_{jk} - \\eta \\delta_k a_j + \\alpha \\Delta w_{jk}^{t-1}$$\n",
