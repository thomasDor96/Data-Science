    "# Introduction to scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scikit-learn` package is an open-source library that provides a robust set of machine learning algorithms for Python. It is built upon the core Python scientific stack (*i.e.* NumPy, SciPy, Cython), and has a simple, consistent API, making it useful for a wide range of statistical learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_static/ml_map.png\" width=\"800px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is about coding programs that automatically adjust their performance from exposure to information encoded in data. This learning is achieved via **tunable parameters** that are automatically adjusted according to performance criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning can be considered a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major classes of ML:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning**\n",
    ": Algorithms which learn from a training set of *labeled* examples (exemplars) to generalize to the set of all possible inputs. Examples of supervised learning include regression and support vector machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised learning**\n",
    ": Algorithms which learn from a training set of *unlableled* examples, using the features of the inputs to categorize inputs together according to some statistical criteria. Examples of unsupervised learning include k-means clustering and kernel density estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning**\n",
    ": Algorithms that learn via reinforcement from a *critic* that provides information on the quality of a solution, but not on how to improve it. Improved solutions are achieved by iteratively exploring the solution space. We will not cover RL in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing Data in scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning algorithms implemented in scikit-learn expect data to be stored in a\n",
    "**two-dimensional array or matrix**.  The arrays can be\n",
    "either ``numpy`` arrays, or in some cases ``scipy.sparse`` matrices.\n",
    "The size of the array is expected to be `[n_samples, n_features]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **n_samples:**   The number of samples: each sample is an item to process (e.g. classify).\n",
    "  A sample can be a document, a picture, a sound, a video, an astronomical object,\n",
    "  a row in database or CSV file,\n",
    "  or whatever you can describe with a fixed set of quantitative traits.\n",
    "- **n_features:**  The number of features or distinct traits that can be used to describe each\n",
    "  item in a quantitative manner.  Features are generally real-valued, but may be boolean or\n",
    "  discrete-valued in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of features must be fixed in advance. However it can be very high dimensional\n",
    "(e.g. millions of features) with most of them being zeros for a given sample. This is a case\n",
    "where `scipy.sparse` matrices can be useful, in that they are\n",
    "much more memory-efficient than numpy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Iris morphometrics\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the datasets included with `scikit-learn` is a set of measurements for flowers, each being a member of one of three species: *Iris Setosa*, *Iris Versicolor* or *Iris Virginica*. \n",

Machine learning tasks like feature extraction, feature selection or dimensionality reduction are also provided as estimators.\n",

    "For a given scikit-learn **estimator** object named `model`, several methods are available. Irrespective of the type of **estimator**, there will be a `fit` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `model.fit` : fit training data. For supervised learning applications, this accepts two arguments: the data `X` and the labels `y` (e.g. `model.fit(X, y)`). For unsupervised learning applications, this accepts only a single argument, the data `X` (e.g. `model.fit(X)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "> During the fitting process, the state of the **estimator** is stored in attributes of the estimator instance named with a trailing underscore character (\\_). For example, the sequence of regression trees `sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor` is stored in `estimators_` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **predictor** interface extends the notion of an estimator by adding a `predict` method that takes an array `X_test` and produces predictions based on the learned parameters of the estimator. In the case of supervised learning estimators, this method typically returns the predicted labels or values computed by the model. Some unsupervised learning estimators may also implement the predict interface, such as k-means, where the predicted values are the cluster labels.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- `model.predict` : given a trained model, predict the label of a new set of data. This method accepts one argument, the new data `X_new` (e.g. `model.predict(X_new)`), and returns the learned label for each object in the array.\n",
    "- `model.predict_proba` : For classification problems, some estimators also provide this method, which returns the probability that a new observation has each categorical label. In this case, the label with the highest probability is returned by `model.predict()`.\n",
    "- `model.score` : for classification or regression problems, most (all?) estimators implement a score method.  Scores are between 0 and 1, with a larger score indicating a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is common to modify or ﬁlter data before feeding it to a learning algorithm, some estimators in the library implement a **transformer** interface which deﬁnes a `transform` method. It takes as input some new data `X_test` and yields as output a transformed version. Preprocessing, feature selection, feature extraction and dimensionality reduction algorithms are all provided as transformers within the library.\n",
