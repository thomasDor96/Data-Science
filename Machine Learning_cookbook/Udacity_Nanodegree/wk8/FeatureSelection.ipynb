    "## 2 | Contingency Tables and Pearson's Chi-Squared Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-Squared test is a way of determining the predictive power for a given feature, i.e., how likely are two features to be independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's demonstrate it with a simpler example. Suppose we have a collection 100 mushrooms. 50 mushrooms have bruises, and 50 do not. Also, 50 mushrooms are `edible` (**e**) and 50 are `poisonous` (**p**). A [**contingency table**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table) (also known as a **cross tabulation** or **crosstab**) is a matrix that displays the *multivariate* frequency distribution of the variables. Below is one possible **observed** contingency table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| `edible`  | **e** | **p** | \n",
    "|-------------|-------|-------| \n",
    "| `bruises` |       |       |\n",
    "| **f**       |    20 |    30 | \n",
    "| **t**       |    30 |    20 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns of this contingency table correspond to (**e**) and (**p**) mushrooms, respectively. The rows correspond to the absence (**f**) or presence (**t**) of bruises on the mushroom, respectively. In this example, there are 20 edible mushrooms without bruises and 30 edible mushrooms with bruises. There are 30 poisonous mushrooms without bruises and 20 poisonous mushrooms with bruises.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we are interested in answering is, based on the observed contingency table, are these two features (edible and bruises) *independent*? [Pearson's Chi-Squared Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test) can be used to predict the likelihood that two features are independent. First, we need to compute the **expected** (or **theoretical**) contingency table for independent features. For example, what frequency of edible mushrooms with bruises would we expect from a set of 100 mushrooms where 50 are edible and 50 have bruises? We could compute this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{array}{c}\\text{Theoretical}\\\\\\text{frequency of}\\\\\\text{edible mushrooms}\\\\\\text{with bruises}\\end{array} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\text{Probability of}\\\\\\text{mushroom being}\\\\\\text{edible}\\end{array}\\right) \\times \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\text{Probability of}\\\\\\text{mushroom having}\\\\\\text{bruises}\\end{array}\\right) \\times\n",
    "\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\text{Total}\\\\\\text{number of}\\\\\\text{mushrooms}\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{50}{100}\\right)\\left(\\frac{50}{100}\\right)\\left(\\vphantom{\\frac{50}{100}}100\\right)={\\ 25\\ }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can repeat this calculation for each entry in the contingency table to obtain the  **expected** (or **theoretical**) contingency table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **edible**  | **e** | **p** | \n",
    "|-------------|-------|-------| \n",
    "| **bruises** |       |       |\n",
    "| **f**       |    25 |    25 | \n",
    "| **t**       |    25 |    25 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the observed and expected frequencies, we can compute $\\chi^2$ test statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\chi^2=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{\\left(E_i-O_i\\right)^2}{E_i}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the meanings of symbols are shown below:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - $\\chi^2$ is Pearson's cumulative test statistic, which asymptotically approaches a [$\\chi^2$ distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution)\n",
    "  - $n$ is the number of cells in the contingency table (in our example, $n=4$)\n",
    "  - $E_i$ is the **expected** (or **theoretical**) frequency for the $i^{\\text{th}}$ cell of the contingency table.\n",
    "  - $O_i$ is the **observed** (or **actual**) frequency for the $i^{\\text{th}}$ cell of the contingency table.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The value of our $\\chi^2$ test statistic is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi^2=\\frac{\\left(25-20\\right)^2}{25}+\\frac{\\left(25-30\\right)^2}{25}+\\frac{\\left(25-30\\right)^2}{25}+\\frac{\\left(25-20\\right)^2}{25}=4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether a $\\chi^2$ test statistic is statistically significant, we will also need to compute the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)\">**degrees of freedom**</a> (DoF). For a feature with $N$ distinct classes, there are $N-1$ DoF. For example, there are 2 classes for the `bruises` feature: **t** or **f**, and hence only 1 DoF. To get the total DoF from multiple features, simply **multiply** the DoF for each feature: in our example, there is 1 DoF from the `bruises` feature and 1 DoF from the `edible` feature. The total DoF is simply $1\\times1=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can compute the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value\">**p-value**</a> of the test statistic $\\chi^2=4$ with 1 DoF, which is equal to 1 minus the **cumulative distribution function** ([`chi2.cdf` from the `scipy` package](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chi2.html)).

    "\n",
    "Univariate feature selection is one way to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, but it has some shortcomings:\n",
    "  - Features that are useful when combined would be ignored.\n",
    "  - The particular instances or inputs that are correctly classified do not shape the feature selection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach would be to use [**recursive feature elimination (RFE)**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#rfe). With RFE, an estimator is first trained on the initial set of features. During the training step, weights are assigned to each feature. Next, features whose absolute weights are the **smallest** are pruned from the set. The idea is that the feature with the smallest absolute weight would change the model the least if it were removed from the set of features. This procedure is repeated until the desired number of features is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the `sklearn` documentation for [`RFE`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html). Note that the `estimator` parameter must have a `coef_` attribute that, after fitting with the `fit` method, holds the fitted parameters. More important features must correspond to higher absolute values of `coef_`. But if we check the `RandomForestClassifier` documentation, there is no `coef_` attribute. However, there is a `feature_importances_` attribute that ranks the model features by importance. A simple adaptation, [a solution found on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24123498/recursive-feature-elimination-on-random-forest-using-scikit-learn), shows how to make `RandomForestClassifier` compatible with `RFE`. \n",

    "1. **univariate feature selection** and `SelectKBest()`    \n",
    "    - Univariate feature selection seems to be a computationally inexpensive way to pare down the dimensionality of a data set, but at the expense of missing out on features that work well in tandem. \n",
    "    - We need a score function to determine the predictive power of each feature. For classification problems, the **Chi-Squared** $(\\chi^2)$ test statistic can be used as a score function for `SelectKBest()`. As the value of $\\chi^2$ increases for a pair of features, it becomes less likely that the two features are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **recursive feature elimination**: `RFE()` and `RFECV()`  \n",
    "    - With `RFE`, we need to have *a priori* the number of features to retain for the final model. RFE is a bit more computationally expensive than univariate feature selection. But RFE generally yields better results than univariate feature selection for the same number of features, because RFE can capture more complex relationships.   \n",
    "    - With `RFECV`, cross-validation scores are used to rank each number of features, and the final model will have a number of features that maximizes the cross-validation score.   \n",
    "    - We saw that it's important that the fit estimator have some `coef_` attribute that contains a value for each feature, increasing with increasing feature importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to feature selection, you may also use **feature transformation** to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which we discussed in last session."
