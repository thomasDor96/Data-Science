# Udacity_connect

This repo contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks to accompany the Udacity Connect Intensive [Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). The code is written for Python 2.7, but should be (mostly) compatible with Python 3.

- Week 3 (`wk3/`)  
	- `RegressionModels.ipynb`: Introduction to the implementation and evaluatoin of regression models to predict housing price with `sklearn`.    
	- `RegressionModels-solution.ipynb`: The solution to the `RegressionModels.ipynb`

- Week 4 (`wk4/`)  
	- `NeuralNets_Miniproject.ipynb`: Introduction to the fundamentals of neural networks, the implementation of single layer and multi layer perceptrons, and perceptron with `scikit-learn`.    
	- `NeuralNets_Miniproject-solution.ipynb`: The solution to the `NeuralNets_Miniproject.ipynb` notebook. 


- Week 5 (`wk5/`)  
	- `BayesNLP_Miniproject.ipynb`: Introduction to Bayes theorem and application of Bayes theorem in natual language processing. Write Python methods to calculate maximum likelihood of a word based on the preceding word, and build a Bayes classifier that computes with a context the optimal label for a second missing word based on the possible words that could be in the first blank.    
	- `BayesNLP_Miniproject-solution.ipynb`: The solution to the `BayesNLP_Miniproject.ipynb` notebook. 
	- `Quiz.pdf`: some quiz on supervised learning. 


- Week 6 (`wk6/`)   
	- `Clustering.ipynb`: Perform K-Means clustering on the Enron dataset. Visualize different clusters that form before and after feature scaling. Plot decision boundaries that arise from K-Means clustering using two of the features.      
	- `Clustering-solution.ipynb`: The solution to the `Clustering.ipynb` notebook.

	- `PCA.ipynb`: Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a large set of features to explain as much of the variance as possible in the data using a smaller set of features. Visualize the eigenfaces (orthonormal basis of components) that result from PCA. The dataset omes from "Labeled Faces in the Wild" (LFW), a database of more than 13,000 face photographs designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face recognition.  
	- `PCA-solution.ipynb`: The solution to the `PCA.ipynb` notebook.

Learn how to do recursive feature elimination using the `RFE` class and RFE with cross-validation (`RFECV`) from scikit-learn. 
	- `FeatureSelection-solution.ipynb`: The solution to the `FeatureSelection.ipynb` notebook. 


- Week 9 (`wk9/`) 
	- `Kaggle.ipynb`: Introduction to the process of creating machine learning solutions to a real world problem. Practice kills such as data analysis and visualization, model building, evaluation and optimization on a real world dataset.  

- Week 10 (`wk10/`)
	- `MNIST_Demo.ipynb`: Introduction to TensorFlow and Keras. Learn how to build neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras to solve a multiclass classification problem. Compare TensorFlow and Keras.  

- Week 11 (`wk11/`)
