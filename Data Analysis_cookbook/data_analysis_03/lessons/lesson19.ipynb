Each class instance can have **attributes** attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have **methods** (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\n",

Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Programmers call functions that are part of classes \"methods\". They're the same thing.\n",
    "* Instead of naming your functions after what the function does, instead name it as if it's a command you are giving to the class. For example, `mylist.pop()` not `mylist.remove_from_end_of_list`.\n",
    "* Keep your functions small and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your class should use \"camelcase\" like `SuperGoldFactory` rather than `super_gold_factory`.\n",
    "* Your other functions should use \"underscore format\" so write `my_awesome_hair` and not `myawe-somehair` or `MyAwesomeHair`.\n",
    "* Be consistent in how you organize your function arguments. For example, if you have one function that takes `(dog, cat, user)`, don't have another that the other takes `(user, cat, dog)`.\n",
    "* Try not to use variables that come from the module or globals.\n",
    "* Always, always have `className(object)` format or else you will be in big trouble.\n",

    "#### Readability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Give your code vertical space (between lines) and horizontal space (between operators or commas) so people can read it.\n",
    "* If you can't read it out loud, it's probably hard to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write comments.\n",
    "* When you write comments, describe why you are doing what you are doing. The code already says how, but why you did things the way you did is more important.\n",
    "* When you write doc comments for your functions, make them for someone who will have to use your code. Give them a sentence about what someone can do with that function.\n",
    "* Keep your comments relatively short and to the point, and if you change a function, review the comment to make sure it's still correct."
