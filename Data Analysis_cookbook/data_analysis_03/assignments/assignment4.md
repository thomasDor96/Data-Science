### Assignment 4 - Python Fundamentals II

Complete the tasks below. Please turn in a single Jupyter notebook named `4_first_last.ipynb` (substitute your first and last name). Please run Kernel > Restart & Run All on your notebook before turning in.

**1.** Lists and loops.

* Create a list of 10 random integers in the range of -100 to 100. 
* Loop through that list using a for loop. 
* Put the non-negative (positive or zero) integers into a new list. 
* If negative integers are encountered, print a message saying that the value is negative and printing that value.

**2.** Functions, lists, and loops.

* Write a function that does what you did in #1 but with the following differences: 
* The input list can be any list of numbers.
* The function should take as an argument some cutoff for being included in the new list (e.g., if you want non-negative integers, the criterion would be >=0 and the cutoff would be 0).
* The printed message for failing to be included should also reflect this user-defined parameter.
* The new list should be returned by the function.

**3.** Dictionaries and list enumeration.

* Create a two-dimensional list with 3 'rows' and 4 'columns' and a mixture of strings and integers. 
* Loop through each element of the list and check if each element is a string or an integer. 
* Save the strings as a dictionary with the index (row, column) as the key and the string as the value.
* Save the integers as a dictionary with the index (row, column) as the key and the string as the value.

**4.** List comprehension and saving files.

* Create a list of 5 strings that are first and last names, e.g. `'Jon Doe'`. 
* Use a list comprehension (a single-line command) to get the first initial from each name and store each string (e.g. `'J'`) in a new list. 
* Repeat but store both the first and last initial (e.g. `'JD'`) in a new list. 
* Save this second list to a text file.

**5.** Reading files, sets, and saving files.

* Download this text file of past [World Series winners](https://github.com/cuttlefishh/python-for-data-analysis/blob/master/data/world_series_winners.txt). 
* Read in the lines of the file to a list, so that each line is an element of the list. 
* Create a new list with just those list elements that contain 'New York'; print that list, making sure there's not an extra newline character between each line. 
* Use the set class to convert the list of all World Series winners to a list of unique values. 
* Write the output to a new file.
